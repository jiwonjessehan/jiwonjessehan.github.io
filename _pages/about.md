I'm a 3rd year Astrophysics PhD student at Harvard University, working with prof. [Charlie Conroy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy). Recently I've been interested in how the [dark matter halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07662) of our Galaxy has been shaped by an ancient major merger.

Outside of science, I spend a lot of time climbing rocks & ice, [spreading dance](https://gsas.harvard.edu/news/stories/scene-leader), and thinking about [coffee](https://improbable.com/2021/02/17/the-reason-you-will-spill-coffee-no-matter-how-careful-you-are/).
