I'm a final year PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at Harvard University, working with prof. [Charlie Conroy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy) and [Lars Hernquist](https://www.hernquist.group/). Recently I've been interested in how the [stellar halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04327) and the [dark matter halo](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac795f) of our Galaxy has been shaped by an ancient major merger, leading to the [warping of the disk](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023NatAs...7.1481H/abstract). I've also been thinking about [how to image the whole sky](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230611784H/abstract) with the _Roman_ space telescope.

Outside of science, I spend a lot of time climbing [rocks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSpxS8ys8it/) & [ice](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaAoIXku4fS/), [spreading dance](https://gsas.harvard.edu/news/stories/scene-leader), and thinking about [coffee](https://improbable.com/2021/02/17/the-reason-you-will-spill-coffee-no-matter-how-careful-you-are/).
